User Story #3

As a logged-in user, I want to watch either a movie or TV show with my friends and want a Netflix recommendation that we would all like. 

One of the user’s will open up the web application, and will be asked to log in with their Twitter account, as detailed in the user log in story. After the user has logged in, they will be presented with an option to watch with companions. The user can then select which friends’ accounts they would like as companions and then select Find Me a Recommendation. The web application will then gather the interested lists, as detailed in User Story #1, from all of the profiles and find the intersection between these lists. When the web application has found a common intersection, it will present the user with a recommendation. If they agree to watch the recommendation they can select Take me to Netflix, and begin watching the show or movie. Otherwise, the user can select Find Me a Recommendation again and the web application will present another recommendation based off of the intersections found.
